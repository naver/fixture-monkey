## Fixture Monkey

Fixture Monkey is a Java & Kotlin library designed to generate controllable arbitrary test objects.
Its most distinctive feature is the ability to freely access and configure any nested fields through path-based expressions.

It focuses on simplifying test writing, by facilitating the generation of necessary test fixtures.
Whether you're dealing with basic or complex test fixtures, Fixture Monkey helps you to effortlessly create the test objects you need and easily customize them to match your desired configurations.

Make your JVM tests more concise and safe with Fixture Monkey.

---------

## Why use Fixture Monkey?
### 1. Simplicity
```java
Product actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeOne(Product.class);
```
Fixture Monkey makes test object generation remarkably easy. With just one line of code, you can effortlessly generate any kind of test object you desire.
It simplifies the given section of the test, enabling you to write tests faster and more easily. You also don't need to change the production code or test environment.

### 2. Reusability
```java
// Basic property setting
ArbitraryBuilder<Product> actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class)
    .set("id", 1000L)
    .set("productName", "Book");

// Setting collection size
ArbitraryBuilder<Product> productWithReviews = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class)
    .size("reviews", 3);  // Set reviews collection to have exactly 3 elements

// Setting specific collection elements
ArbitraryBuilder<Product> productWithSpecificReviews = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class)
    .set("reviews[0].rating", 5)  // Set first review's rating to 5
    .set("reviews[1].comment", "Great product!");  // Set second review's comment
```
Fixture Monkey allows you to reuse configurations of instances across multiple tests, saving you time and effort.
Complex specifications only need to be defined once within your builder and can then be reused to obtain instances.

Furthermore, ArbitraryBuilder employs lazy evaluation, meaning that objects are only created when you actually call `sample()`. This approach ensures that you only pay the creation cost when you need the object, making your tests more efficient.

There are additional features that boost reusability. For more details on these features, refer to the sections on 'Registering Default ArbitraryBuilder' and 'InnerSpec'.

### 3. Randomness
```java
ArbitraryBuilder<Product> actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class);

then(actual.sample()).isNotEqualTo(actual.sample());
```
Fixture Monkey helps tests become more dynamic by generating test objects with random values.
This leads to uncovering edge cases that might remain hidden when using static data.

### 4. Versatility
```java
// inheritance
class Foo {
  String foo;
}

class Bar extends Foo {
    String bar;
}

Foo foo = FixtureMonkey.create().giveMeOne(Foo.class);
Bar bar = FixtureMonkey.create().giveMeOne(Bar.class);

// circular-reference
class Foo {
    String value;

    Foo foo;
}

Foo foo = FixtureMonkey.create().giveMeOne(Foo.class);

// anonymous objects
interface Foo {
    Bar getBar();
}

class Bar {
    String value;
}

Foo foo = FixtureMonkey.create().giveMeOne(Foo.class);
```

Fixture Monkey is capable to create any kind of object you can imagine. It supports generating basic objects such as lists, nested collections, enums and generic types.
It also handles more advanced scenarios, including objects with inheritance relationships, circular-referenced objects, and anonymous objects that implement interfaces.

### 5. Deep Customization
```java
class Order {
    List<OrderItem> items;
    Customer customer;
    Address shippingAddress;
}

class OrderItem {
    Product product;
    int quantity;
}

class Product {
    String name;
    List<Review> reviews;
}

// Set all product names to "Special Product"
ArbitraryBuilder<Order> orderBuilder = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Order.class)
    .set("items[*].product.name", "Special Product");

// Set all review ratings to 5 stars
ArbitraryBuilder<Order> orderWithGoodReviews = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Order.class)
    .set("items[*].product.reviews[*].rating", 5);

// Set all quantities to 2
ArbitraryBuilder<Order> orderWithFixedQuantity = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Order.class)
    .set("items[*].quantity", 2);
```
Unlike other test data generation libraries, Fixture Monkey provides powerful path expressions that allow you to apply operations to all nested fields at any depth.
Using the `[*]` wildcard operator, you can easily set values for all elements in collections or apply operations to all nested objects that match the path pattern.
This feature significantly reduces the amount of code needed to customize complex object structures and makes your test code more maintainable.

## Proven Effectiveness
Fixture Monkey was originally developed as an in-house library at [Naver](https://www.navercorp.com/en) and played a crucial role in simplifying test object generation for the Plasma project.
The Plasma project aimed to revolutionize Naver Pay's architecture, which is the most used mobile payment service in South Korea with a daily active user count of 261,400.

The project required thorough testing of complex business requirements, and with Fixture Monkey's assistance, the team efficiently wrote over 10,000 tests, uncovering critical edge cases and ensuring the system's reliability.
Now available as an open-source library, developers worldwide can take advantage of Fixture Monkey to simplify their test codes and build robust applications with confidence.
