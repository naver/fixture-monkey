Creating test data is one of the most important and time-consuming parts of writing tests. Fixture Monkey simplifies this task by providing an easy and flexible way to generate test objects of any complexity.

This section covers:
- Creating a FixtureMonkey instance - the main entry point for generating test objects
- Basic object generation methods for simple and common use cases
- Handling complex types like interfaces and generic types
- Customizing how objects are created and initialized

Whether you need a simple POJO or a complex object graph with specific constraints, Fixture Monkey's intuitive API makes test data generation straightforward and maintainable.
