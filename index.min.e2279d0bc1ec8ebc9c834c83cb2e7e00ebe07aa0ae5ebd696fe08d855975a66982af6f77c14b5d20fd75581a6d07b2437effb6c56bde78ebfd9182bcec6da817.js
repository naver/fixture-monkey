It focuses on simplifying test writing, by facilitating the generation of necessary test fixtures. Whether you&rsquo;re dealing with basic or complex test fixtures, Fixture Monkey helps you to effortlessly create the test objects you need and easily customize them to match your desired configurations.
Make your JVM tests more concise and safe with Fixture Monkey.
Why use Fixture Monkey? # 1. Simplicity # Product actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeOne(Product.class); Fixture Monkey makes test object generation remarkably easy. With just one line of code, you can effortlessly generate any kind of test object you desire. It simplifies the given section of the test, enabling you to write tests faster and more easily. You also don&rsquo;t need to change the production code or test environment.
2. Reusability # ArbitraryBuilder&lt;Product&gt; actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .set(&quot;id&quot;, 1000L) .set(&quot;productName&quot;, &quot;Book&quot;); Fixture Monkey allows you to reuse configurations of instances across multiple tests, saving you time and effort. Complex specifications only need to be defined once within your builder and can then be reused to obtain instances.
Furthermore, there are additional features that boost reusability. For more details on these features, refer to the sections on &lsquo;Registering Default ArbitraryBuilder&rsquo; and &lsquo;InnerSpec&rsquo;.
3. Randomness # ArbitraryBuilder&lt;Product&gt; actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class); then(actual.sample()).isNotEqualTo(actual.sample()); Fixture Monkey helps tests become more dynamic by generating test objects with random values. This leads to uncovering edge cases that might remain hidden when using static data.
4. Versatility # // inheritance class Foo { String foo; } class Bar extends Foo { String bar; } Foo foo = FixtureMonkey.create().giveMeOne(Foo.class); Bar bar = FixtureMonkey.create().giveMeone(Bar.class); // circular-reference class Foo { String value; Foo foo; } Foo foo = FixtureMonkey.create().giveMeOne(Foo.class); // anonymous objects interface Foo { Bar getBar(); } class Bar { String value; } Foo foo = FixtureMonkey.create().giveMeOne(Foo.class); Fixture Monkey is capable to create any kind of object you can imagine. It supports generating basic objects such as lists, nested collections, enums and generic types. It also handles more advanced scenarios, including objects with inheritance relationships, circular-referenced objects, and anonymous objects that implement interfaces.
Proven Effectiveness # Fixture Monkey was originally developed as an in-house library at Naver and played a crucial role in simplifying test object generation for the Plasma project. The Plasma project aimed to revolutionize Naver Pay&rsquo;s architecture, which is the most used mobile payment service in South Korea with a daily active user count of 261,400.
The project required thorough testing of complex business requirements, and with Fixture Monkey&rsquo;s assistance, the team efficiently wrote over 10,000 tests, uncovering critical edge cases and ensuring the system&rsquo;s reliability. Now available as an open-source library, developers worldwide can take advantage of Fixture Monkey to simplify their test codes and build robust applications with confidence.

With the Fixture Monkey library, generating an instance of Product becomes remarkably simple, requiring just few lines of code.
@Test void test() { // given FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .objectIntrospector(ConstructorPropertiesArbitraryIntrospector.INSTANCE) .build(); // when Product actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeOne(Product.class); // then then(actual).isNotNull(); } First, create a FixtureMonkey instance that facilitates the creation of test fixtures. There are several custom options available in Fixture Monkey that allow you to generate instances according to your specific requirements.
Here we are configuring the objectIntrospector to use ConstructorPropertiesArbitraryIntrospector, which means that the object will be constructed using the constructor annotated with @ConstructorProperties. An Introspector defines how Fixture Monkey generates objects.
For ConstructorPropertiesArbitraryIntrospector, the generated class should have a constructor with @ConstructorProperties or you can add lombok.anyConstructor.addConstructorProperties=true in the lombok.config file. (There are alternative Introspectors available, each with their own requirements. Check out the Introspectors section for more details.)
Next, use the giveMeOne() method with the desired test class type to generate an instance of the specified type.

In order to do this, you can get a type builder from fixture monkey with the giveMeBuilder method. The Builder allows chaining additional method calls to customize your fixture. In this case you can use the set() function to set the id to 1,000. From the Builder use sample() to get an instance from the builder.
@Test void test() { // given FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .objectIntrospector(ConstructorPropertiesArbitraryIntrospector.INSTANCE) .build(); long id = 1000; // when Product actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .set(&quot;id&quot;, id) .sample(); // then then(actual.getId()).isEqualTo(1000); } In the example above, you can see that the field id is set to a value you desire.
You can also use Fixture Monkey to work with fields that are collections. For instance, you might want the list &ldquo;options&rdquo; to have a specific size, and you might want a certain element of it to have a certain value.

Java Kotlin @Value public class Product { long id; String productName; long price; List&lt;String&gt; options; Instant createdAt; public Product() { this.id = 0; this.productName = null; this.price = 0; this.options = null; this.createdAt = null; } public Product( String str, long id, long price ) { this.id = id; this.productName = str; this.price = price; this.options = Collections.emptyList(); this.createdAt = Instant.now(); } public Product( long id, long price, List&lt;String&gt; options ) { this.id = id; this.productName = &#34;defaultProductName&#34;; this.price = price; this.options = options; this.createdAt = Instant.now(); } } class Product( val id: Long, val productName: String, val price: Long, val options: List&lt;String&gt;, val createdAt: Instant ) { constructor() : this( id = 0, productName = &#34;&#34;, price = 0, options = emptyList(), createdAt = Instant.now() ) constructor(str: String, id: Long, price: Long) : this( id = id, productName = str, price = price, options = emptyList(), createdAt = Instant.now() ) constructor(id: Long, price: Long, options: List&lt;String&gt;) : this( id = id, productName = &#34;defaultProductName&#34;, price = price, options = options, createdAt = Instant.now() ) companion object { fun from(id: Long, price: Long): Product = Product(&#34;product&#34;, id, price) } } Fixture Monkey allows you to select the exact constructor you&rsquo;d like to use to create the object.
NoArgsConstructor, DefaultConstructor # The most basic way to use instantiate to tell the ArbitraryBuilder to create an object with its constructor is as follows:
Java Kotlin @Test void test() { Product product = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .instantiate(constructor()) .sample(); then(product.getId()).isEqualTo(0); } @Test fun test() { val product = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .instantiateBy { constructor() } .sample() then(product.productName).isEqualTo(&#34;&#34;) } You can specify to use the constructor method by passing the constructor() option. If there is a NoArgsConstructor, it will be used to create the object. If not, the first written constructor is used.
Specifying a Constructor # If a class has multiple constructors, you can specify the desired constructor by providing the necessary parameter information. For instance, consider the Product class with two constructors requiring different parameters.
To use the constructor that creates instances with empty options, specify the paramters as follows:
Java Kotlin @Test void test() { Product product = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .instantiate( constructor() .parameter(String.class) .parameter(long.class) .parameter(long.class) ) .sample(); then(product.getOptions()).isEmpty(); } @RepeatedTest(TEST_COUNT) fun test() { val product = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .instantiateBy { constructor&lt;Product&gt; { parameter&lt;String&gt;() parameter&lt;Long&gt;() parameter&lt;Long&gt;() } } .sample() then(product.options).isEmpty() } If you want to use the other constructor that makes a Product with productName as &ldquo;defaultProductName&rdquo;, you can specify it by just changing the parameter information: Java Kotlin constructor() .parameter(long.class) .parameter(long.class) .parameter(new TypeReference&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;(){}) constructor&lt;Product&gt; { parameter&lt;Long&gt;() parameter&lt;Long&gt;() parameter&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;() } Note that using private constructors is also possible.
Constructor Parameter Hints # In cases where you want to pass a specific value to the constructor, you can add a parameter name hint.
Java Kotlin @Test void test() { Product product = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .instantiate( constructor() .parameter(String.class, &#34;str&#34;) .parameter(long.class) .parameter(long.class) ) .set(&#34;str&#34;, &#34;book&#34;) .sample(); then(product.getProductName()).isEqualTo(&#34;book&#34;); then(product.getOptions()).isEmpty(); } @Test fun test() { val product = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .instantiateBy { constructor&lt;Product&gt; { parameter&lt;String&gt;(&#34;str&#34;) parameter&lt;Long&gt;() parameter&lt;Long&gt;() } } .set(&#34;str&#34;, &#34;book&#34;) .sample() then(product.productName).isEqualTo(&#34;book&#34;) then(product.options).isEmpty() } In this example, we provide a parameter name hint for the productName to be &ldquo;str&rdquo; This allows us to use the set() function to set the productName to the desired value (in this case &ldquo;book&rdquo;).
Although you can set the hint to any name, we recommend that you use the name in the constructor parameter to avoid confusion. Also note that once the name has been changed using the parameter name hint, you can no longer set it using the field name &ldquo;productName&rdquo;.
Using default arguments (Kotlin) # In Kotlin, you have the flexibility to pass an additional value to a constructor parameter option, allowing you to decide whether to use the default argument if one is available.
@Test fun test() { class Product(val productName: String = &quot;defaultProductName&quot;) val product = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .instantiateBy { constructor { parameter&lt;String&gt;(useDefaultArgument = true) } } .sample() then(product.productName).isEqualTo(&quot;defaultProductName&quot;) } Generic Objects # Generic Objects can also be instantiated in a similar way. Consider this sample class GenericObject:
Java Kotlin @Value public class GenericObject&lt;T&gt; { T value; public GenericObject(T value) { this.value = value; } } class GenericObject&lt;T&gt;(var value: T) Java Kotlin @Test void test() { ConstructorTestSpecs.GenericObject&lt;String&gt; genericObject = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder( new TypeReference&lt;ConstructorTestSpecs.GenericObject&lt;String&gt;&gt;() { }) .instantiate( constructor() .parameter(String.class) ) .sample(); then(genericObject).isNotNull(); then(genericObject.getValue()).isNotNull(); } @Test fun test() { val genericObject = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;GenericObject&lt;String&gt;&gt;() .instantiateBy { constructor() { parameter&lt;String&gt;() } } .sample() then(genericObject).isNotNull() then(genericObject.value).isNotNull() } You can specify to use the constructor with the actual type when working with generic objects.
Using Constructors with Nested Objects # In scenarios involving nested objects, where you wish to specify the creation of both objects using their constructors, you can designate each type and specify the constructor to be used.
For example, consider the ProductList class that uses the Product class:
Java Kotlin @Value public class ProductList { String listName; List&lt;Product&gt; list; public ProductList(List&lt;Product&gt; list) { this.listName = &#34;defaultProductListName&#34;; this.list = list; } } class ProductList(val listName: String, val list: List&lt;Product&gt;) { constructor(list: List&lt;Product&gt;) : this(&#34;defaultProductListName&#34;, list) } You can specify to use a certain constructor for both ProductList and Product with their constructors like the following:
Java Kotlin @Test void test() { ProductList productList = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(ProductList.class) .instantiate( ProductList.class, constructor() .parameter(new TypeReference&lt;List&lt;Product&gt;&gt;() {}, &#34;list&#34;) ) .instantiate( Product.class, constructor() .parameter(long.class) .parameter(long.class) .parameter(new TypeReference&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;(){}) ) .size(&#34;list&#34;, 1) .sample(); then(productList.getListName()).isEqualTo(&#34;defaultProductListName&#34;); then(productList.getList()).hasSize(1); then(productList.getList().get(0).getProductName()).isEqualTo(&#34;defaultProductName&#34;); } @Test fun test() { val productList = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;ProductList&gt;() .instantiateBy { constructor&lt;ProductList&gt; { parameter&lt;List&lt;Product&gt;&gt;(&#34;list&#34;) } constructor&lt;Product&gt; { parameter&lt;Long&gt;() parameter&lt;Long&gt;() parameter&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;() } } .size(&#34;list&#34;, 1) .sample() then(productList.listName).isEqualTo(&#34;defaultProductListName&#34;) then(productList.list).hasSize(1) then(productList.list[0].productName).isEqualTo(&#34;defaultProductName&#34;) } 💡 It is also possible to combine both constructor and factory method approaches for different properties within the instantiate method. In the above example, the ProductList can be initialized with the factory method, while the Product can be instantiated using the constructor. Factory Method # The second way to create an object is by using its factory method.
Consider the same Product class above, which now includes a factory method called from.
Java Kotlin @Value public class Product { long id; String productName; long price; List&lt;String&gt; options; Instant createdAt; public Product( String productName, long id, long price ) { this.id = id; this.productName = productName; this.price = price; this.options = Collections.emptyList(); this.createdAt = Instant.now(); } public static Product from(long id, long price) { return new Product(&#34;product&#34;, id, price); } } class Product( val id: Long, val productName: String, val price: Long, val options: List&lt;String&gt; = emptyList(), val createdAt: Instant = Instant.now() ) { companion object { fun from(id: Long, price: Long): Product { return Product(&#34;product&#34;, id, price) } } } Specifying Factory Method # You can specify the factory method to be used by providing its name.
Java Kotlin @Test void test() { Product product = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .instantiate( factoryMethod(&#34;from&#34;) ) .sample(); then(product.getProductName()).isEqualTo(&#34;product&#34;); } @Test fun test() { val product = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .instantiateBy { factory&lt;Product&gt;(&#34;from&#34;) } .sample() then(product.productName).isEqualTo(&#34;product&#34;) } If there are multiple factory methods with the same name, you can differentiate them by specifying parameter type information, similar to how it&rsquo;s done in the constructor() method.
Java Kotlin factoryMethod(&#34;from&#34;) .parameter(String.class) .parameter(Long.class) factory&lt;Product&gt;(&#34;from&#34;) { parameter&lt;String&gt;() parameter&lt;Long&gt;() } Factory Method Parameter Hints # Parameter name hints can also be added when using factory(), and it works the same as the parameter name hint of constructor().
Java Kotlin @Test void test() { Product product = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .instantiate( factoryMethod(&#34;from&#34;) .parameter(long.class, &#34;productId&#34;) .parameter(long.class) ) .set(&#34;productId&#34;, 100L) .sample(); then(product.getProductName()).isEqualTo(&#34;product&#34;); then(product.getId()).isEqualTo(100L); } @Test fun test() { val product = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .instantiateBy { factory&lt;Product&gt;(&#34;from&#34;) { parameter&lt;String&gt;(&#34;productId&#34;) parameter&lt;Long&gt;() } } .set(&#34;productId&#34;, 100L) .sample() then(product.productName).isEqualTo(&#34;product&#34;) then(product.id).isEqualTo(100L) } Field &amp; JavaBeansProperty # For each instantiation method (constructor() and factory()), you can choose whether to generate properties based on the fields or the JavaBeans Property (getter &amp; setter).
Java Kotlin .instantiate(constructor().field()) // generate based on fields .instantiate(constructor().javaBeansProperty()) // generate based on JavaBeans Property .instantiateBy { constructor { javaField() } } .instantiateBy { constructor { javaBeansProperty() } } If you use field, the value for the fields will be generated. If you use javaBeans Property, having a getter and setter in your class is sufficient, and a random value will be generated.
Excluding properties # To exclude some properties from being generated, you can use the filter() method.
Java Kotlin .instantiate( constructor() .field(it -&gt; it.filter(field -&gt; !Modifier.isPrivate(field.getModifiers()))) ) .instantiate( constructor() .javaBeansProperty(it -&gt; it.filter(property -&gt; !&#34;string&#34;.equals(property.getName()))) ) .instantiateBy { constructor { javaField { filter { !Modifier.isPrivate(it.modifiers) } } } } .instantiateBy { constructor { javaBeansProperty { filter { &#34;string&#34; != it.name } } } } For example, you can exclude private fields from being generated as shown in the first example, or you can filter out certain properties by name, as demonstrated in the second example.

An InnerSpec is a type-independent specification for the customizations to be applied.
Instances of InnerSpec can be reused to consistently and easily configure nested properties. This feature is particularly beneficial when customizing map properties.
For additional guidance, refer to InnerSpec
Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, it -&gt; it.entry(1000, &#34;ABC Store&#34;)); fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .setInner(innerSpec) val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.entry(1000, &#34;ABC Store&#34;) } fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .setInner(innerSpec) setLazy() # The setLazy() function assigns the property a value obtained from the provided Supplier. The Supplier will run every time the ArbitraryBuilder is sampled.
This can be particularly useful when you need to generate unique sequential IDs or set the most recent value.
Java Kotlin AtomicReference&lt;Long&gt; variable = new AtomicReference&lt;&gt;(0L); ArbitraryBuilder&lt;Long&gt; builder = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Long.class) .setLazy(&#34;$&#34;, () -&gt; variable.getAndSet(variable.get() + 1)); Long actual1 = builder.sample(); // actual1 == 0 Long actual2 = builder.sample(); // actual2 == 1 var variable = 0L val builder = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Long::class.java) .setLazy(&#34;$&#34;) { variable++ } val actual1 = builder.sample() // actual1 == 0 val actual2 = builder.sample() // actual2 == 1 setPostCondition() # setPostCondition() can be used when your fixture needs to adhere to a specific condition. This condition can be defined by passing a predicate.
🚨 Using setPostCondition can incur higher costs for narrow conditions. In such cases, it's recommended to use set instead. Java Kotlin fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .setPostCondition(&#34;id&#34;, Long.class, it -&gt; it &gt; 0) fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product::class.java) .setPostConditionExp(Product::id, Long::class.java) { it: Long -&gt; it &gt; 0 } fixed() # fixed() can be used when you want your arbitrary builder to consistently return instances with the same values every time it is sampled.
Java Kotlin fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .fixed() fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .fixed() limit # For the set(), setLazy(), and setPostCondition() methods, you can include an additional parameter that determines the number of times the customization will be applied.

For instance, let&rsquo;s assume you want the &ldquo;productName&rdquo; field to match the generated &ldquo;id&rdquo; of the Product. You can use thenApply() as follows:
Java Kotlin fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .thenApply((it, builder) -&gt; builder.set(&#34;productName&#34;, it.getId().toString())) fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product::class.java) .thenApply{it, builder -&gt; builder.setExp(Product::productName, it.id.toString())} acceptIf() # You might also find the need to perform additional customization based on a specific condition.

The following code example demonstrates ways to customize random values using set() with Arbitrary: Java Kotlin Product actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .set(&#34;id&#34;, Arbitraries.longs().greaterOrEqual(1000)) .set(&#34;productName&#34;, Arbitraries.strings().withCharRange(&#39;a&#39;, &#39;z&#39;).ofMaxLength(10)) .set(&#34;productType&#34;, Arbitraries.of(ProductType.CLOTHING, ProductType.ELECTRONICS)) .sample(); then(actual.getId()).isGreaterThanOrEqualTo(1000); then(actual.getProductName()).matches(&#34;^[a-z]+$&#34;); then(actual.getProductName().length()).isLessThanOrEqualTo(10); then(actual.getProductType()).matches(it -&gt; it == ProductType.CLOTHING || it == ProductType.ELECTRONICS); val actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .setExp(Product::id, Arbitraries.longs().greaterOrEqual(1000)) .setExp(Product::productName, Arbitraries.strings().withCharRange(&#39;a&#39;, &#39;z&#39;).ofMaxLength(10)) .setExp(Product::productType, Arbitraries.of(ProductType.CLOTHING, ProductType.ELECTRONICS)) .sample() then(actual.id).isGreaterThanOrEqualTo(1000) then(actual.productName).matches(&#34;^[a-z]+$&#34;) then(actual.productName.length).isLessThanOrEqualTo(10) then(actual.productType).matches { it -&gt; it === ProductType.CLOTHING || it === ProductType.ELECTRONICS } For further details about Jqwik and Arbitrary, check out Jqwik User Guide

💡 Kotlin EXP is not supported for InnerSpec, as it is designed to be type-independent. Instead, you need to specify the property by its name. Applying InnerSpec to the ArbitraryBuilder # To apply your pre-defined InnerSpec to the builder, use the setInner() method as shown below:
Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec().property(&#34;id&#34;, 1000); fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .setInner(innerSpec); val innerSpec = InnerSpec().property(&#34;id&#34;, 1000) fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .setInner(innerSpec) Customizing properties # property() # Similar to the set() method in ArbitraryBuilder, you can customize a property by specifying its name and providing the desired value.
🚨 Fixture Monkey expressions such as refering elements (\`[]\`) or nested fields(\`.\`) are not allowed as the property name. Only the property name itself is allowed. Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;id&#34;, 1000); val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;id&#34;, 1000) size(), minSize(), maxSize() # size(), minSize(), and maxSize() can be used to specify the size of the property.
As previously mentioned, InnerSpec defines customizations in a nested manner. You can first select the container property using property() and then proceed to define an innerSpec consumer to set the size.
Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;options&#34;, options -&gt; options.size(5)); // size:5 InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;options&#34;, options -&gt; options.size(3, 5)); // minSize:3, maxSize:5 InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;options&#34;, options -&gt; options.minSize(3)); // minSize:3 InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;options&#34;, options -&gt; options.maxSize(5)); // maxSize:5 val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;options&#34;) { it.size(5) } // size:5 val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;options&#34;) { it.size(3, 5) } // minSize:3, maxSize:5 val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;options&#34;) { it.minSize(3) } // minSize:3 val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;options&#34;) { it.maxSize(5) } // maxSize:5 postCondition() # postCondition() can be used when you require your property to match a specific condition.
🚨 Using setPostCondition can incur higher costs for narrow conditions. In such cases, it's recommended to use set instead. Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;id&#34;, id -&gt; id.postCondition(Long.class, it -&gt; it &gt; 0)); val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;id&#34;) { it.postCondition(Long::class.java) { it &gt; 0 }} inner() # You can also customize a property using another pre-defined InnerSpec with the help of inner().
Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;id&#34;, 1000L); fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .setInner( new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;nestedObject&#34;, nestedObject -&gt; nestedObject.inner(innerSpec)) ); val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;id&#34;, 1000L) fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .setInner( InnerSpec() .property(&#34;nestedObject&#34;) { it.inner(innerSpec) } ) Customizing list properties # listElement() # Individual elements within lists can be selected using listElement(). This is equivalent to referencing elements with &ldquo;[n]&rdquo; using expressions.
Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;options&#34;, options -&gt; options.listElement(0, &#34;red&#34;)); val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;options&#34;) { it.listElement(0, &#34;red&#34;) } allListElement() # If you wish to set all elements of the list simultaneously, you can use allListElement(). This is equivalent to referencing elements with &ldquo;[*]&rdquo; using expressions.
Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;options&#34;, options -&gt; options.allListElement(&#34;red&#34;)); val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;options&#34;) { it.allListElement(&#34;red&#34;) } Customizing map properties # InnerSpec provides special methods for customizing map property entries.
🚨 Similar to lists, setting a map entry without specifying the size first might lead to no change. Prior to setting a value, ensure that the map property has the intended size. key(), value(), entry() # You can customize map property entries using key(), value(), and entry() methods. Using key() assigns a specified value to the key of a map entry, while the entry&rsquo;s value remains randomized. Similarly, value() assigns a specified value to the map entry&rsquo;s value, while the key becomes randomized. If you want to specify both the key and value at once, you can use entry().
Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.key(1000)); InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.value(&#34;ABC Store&#34;)); InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.entry(1000, &#34;ABC Store&#34;)); val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.key(1000) } val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.value(&#34;ABC Store&#34;) } val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.entry(1000, &#34;ABC Store&#34;) } keys(), values(), entries() # When setting multiple entries within a map, you can use keys(), values(), and entries() to pass multiple values.
Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.keys(1000, 1001, 1002)); InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.values(&#34;ABC Store&#34;, &#34;123 Convenience&#34;, &#34;XYZ Mart&#34;)); InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.entries(1000, &#34;ABC Store&#34;, 1001, &#34;123 Convenience&#34;, 1002, &#34;XYZ Mart&#34;)); val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.keys(1000, 1001, 1002) } val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.values(&#34;ABC Store&#34;, &#34;123 Convenience&#34;, &#34;XYZ Mart&#34;) } val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.entries(1000, &#34;ABC Store&#34;, 1001, &#34;123 Convenience&#34;, 1002, &#34;XYZ Mart&#34;) } allKey(), allValue(), allEntry() # Similar to allListElement(), it is possible to set every entry within the map to the specified value with allKey(), allValue(), and allEntry().
Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.allKey(1000)); InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.allValue(&#34;ABC Store&#34;)); InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.allEntry(1000, &#34;ABC Store&#34;)); val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.allKey(1000) } val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.allValue(&#34;ABC Store&#34;) } val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.allEntry(1000, &#34;ABC Store&#34;) } keyLazy(), valueLazy(), entryLazy() # Similar to the setLazy() method in ArbitraryBuilder, you can pass a Supplier to assign the value. The Supplier will run every time the ArbitraryBuilder with the InnerSpec applied is sampled.
Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.keyLazy(this::generateMerchantKey)); InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.valueLazy(this::generateMerchantValue)); InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.entryLazy(this::generateMerchantKey, this::generateMerchantValue)); val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.keyLazy(this::generateMerchantKey) } val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.valueLazy(this::generateMerchantValue) } val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.entryLazy(this::generateMerchantKey, this::generateMerchantValue) } allKeyLazy(), allValueLazy(), allEntryLazy() # Just as with the allKey() method, you can use allKeyLazy() to apply keyLazy() to every entry within the map. Both allValueLazy() and allEntryLazy() function similarly.
Java Kotlin InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.allKeyLazy(this::generateMerchantKey)); InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.allValueLazy(this::generateMerchantValue)); InnerSpec innerSpec = new InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;, merchantInfo -&gt; merchantInfo.allEntryLazy(this::generateMerchantKey, this::generateMerchantValue)); val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.allKeyLazy(this::generateMerchantKey) } val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.allValueLazy(this::generateMerchantValue) } val innerSpec = InnerSpec() .property(&#34;merchantInfo&#34;) { it.allEntryLazy(this::generateMerchantKey, this::generateMerchantValue) } Customizing nested Maps # By combining methods within InnerSpec, you can effectively customize maps with map-type keys, map-type values, or both.
Consider the scenario of a nested map structure like the following:
public class Example { Map&lt;Map&lt;String, String&gt;, String&gt; mapByString; Map&lt;String, Map&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; stringByMap; } Setting map-type key # To set a map with a map-type key, you can access the map key using key(), and then further customize it.

Property # In the documentation, the term property is consistently used instead of field when referring to the characteristics of a class&rsquo;s object. While it has the same name as &lsquo;property&rsquo; in Kotlin, the concept is different in Fixture Monkey.
Fixture Monkey&rsquo;s initial structure was primarily based on fields, which imposed limitations on configuration and control through methods and other mechanisms. For example, when relying solely on fields, it&rsquo;s not possible to access annotations on setter methods. To address this limitation, the Property interface was introduced, which extends support beyond just fields.
A property in Fixture Monkey, functions as a fundamental component within a class and can represent a Field, Method, or Kotlin Property. It contains information about its Type, Annotations on it, and its name.
Moreover, in Fixture Monkey, the characteristics of both Objects and Containers are also expressed through the concept of property.
ObjectProperty # An ObjectProperty is a property that represents immutable object information. It includes:
property: The property of the object itself. propertyNameResolver: Determines how the property name is resolved. nullInject: The probability of injecting null value. elementIndex: If the object is an element of a Container, it indicates the index. childPropertyListsByCandidateProperty: A map that holds information about child properties grouped by candidate property. public final class ObjectProperty { private final Property property; private final PropertyNameResolver propertyNameResolver; private final double nullInject; @Nullable private final Integer elementIndex; private final Map&lt;Property, List&lt;Property&gt;&gt; childPropertyListsByCandidateProperty; } ContainerProperty # The property of a container type is represented by ContainerProperty, which describes immutable container information. It includes:
elementProperties: A list of element properties. containerInfo: TheArbitraryContainerInfo that determines the container&rsquo;s size. public final class ContainerProperty { private final List&lt;Property&gt; elementProperties; private final ArbitraryContainerInfo containerInfo; } Options # In Fixture Monkey, several options share common characteristics. For example, let&rsquo;s take a look at the options related to modifying the ObjectPropertyGenerator
defaultObjectPropertyGenerator, pushObjectPropertyGenerator, pushAssignableTypeObjectPropertyGenerator, pushExactTypeObjectPropertyGenerator
Options with the prefix default are applied as defaults to all properties generated by Fixture Monkey. These defaults set a basic behavior that affects all property types uniformly.
However, if you need to apply specific options for a particular type, you can make use of the options that start with push. There are three variations of these push options.
push~ : Accepts a MatcherOperator as a parameter. pushAssignableType~: This option applies the specified setting to every property type for which the given type (associated with the option) is assignable. This means that the option is applied not only to the exact given type but also to any type that can be assigned to the property type, including superclasses or superinterfaces. pushExactType~: This option limits the setting to properties with the exact same type. It does not impact properties with subtype or supertype relationships. It&rsquo;s important to note that options set using the push variants take precedence over the default options. This means that when a push option is defined for a specific type, it will override any corresponding default option for that type.

📖 Notable implementations: 'BooleanIntrospector', 'EnumIntrospector' ContainerIntrospector # pushContainerIntrospector
Especially for container types, you can change the ArbitraryIntrospector using the pushContainerIntrospector option.
📖 Notable implementations: 'ListIntrospector', 'MapIntrospector' ArbitraryGenerator # defaultArbitraryGenerator
Although the ArbitraryIntrospector determines the appropriate arbitrary generation strategy, the actual creation of the final arbitrary(CombinableArbitrary) is done by the ArbitraryGenerator. It handles the request by delegating to the ArbitraryIntrospector. By using the defaultArbitraryGenerator option, you have the capability to customize the behavior of the ArbitraryGenerator.
For instance, you can create an arbitrary generator that produces unique values, as shown in the example below:
Java Kotlin public static class UniqueArbitraryGenerator implements ArbitraryGenerator { private static final Set&lt;Object&gt; UNIQUE = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(); private final ArbitraryGenerator delegate; public UniqueArbitraryGenerator(ArbitraryGenerator delegate) { this.delegate = delegate; } @Override public CombinableArbitrary generate(ArbitraryGeneratorContext context) { return delegate.generate(context) .filter( obj -&gt; { if (!UNIQUE.contains(obj)) { UNIQUE.add(obj); return true; } return false; } ); } } FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .defaultArbitraryGenerator(UniqueArbitraryGenerator::new) .build(); class UniqueArbitraryGenerator(private val delegate: ArbitraryGenerator) : ArbitraryGenerator { companion object { private val UNIQUE = HashSet&lt;Any&gt;() } override fun generate(context: ArbitraryGeneratorContext): CombinableArbitrary { return delegate.generate(context) .filter { obj -&gt; if (!UNIQUE.contains(obj)) { UNIQUE.add(obj) true } else { false } } } } val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .defaultArbitraryGenerator { UniqueArbitraryGenerator(it) } .build() 📖 Notable implementations: 'IntrospectedArbitraryGenerator', 'CompositeArbitraryGenerator' Implement your own Property # PropertyGenerator # defaultPropertyGenerator, pushPropertyGenerator, pushAssignableTypePropertyGenerator, pushExactTypePropertyGenerator
PropertyGenerator creates child properties of the given ObjectProperty. The child property can be a field, JavaBeans property, method or constructor parameter within the parent ObjectProperty. There are scenarios where you might want to customize how these child properties are generated.
The PropertyGenerator options allow you to specify how child properties of each type are generated. This option is mainly used when you want to exclude generating some properties when the parent property has abnormal child properties.
📖 Notable implementations: 'FieldPropertyGenerator', 'JavaBeansPropertyGenerator' ObjectPropertyGenerator # defaultObjectPropertyGenerator, pushObjectPropertyGenerator, pushAssignableTypeObjectPropertyGenerator, pushExactTypeObjectPropertyGenerator
ObjectPropertyGenerator generates the ObjectProperty based on a given context. With options related to ObjectPropertyGenerator you can customize how the ObjectProperty is generated.
📖 Notable implementations: 'DefaultObjectPropertyGenerator' ContainerPropertyGenerator # pushContainerPropertyGenerator, pushAssignableTypeContainerPropertyGenerator, pushExactTypeContainerPropertyGenerator
The ContainerPropertyGenerator determines how to generate ContainerProperty within a given context. With options related to ContainerPropertyGenerator you can customize how the ContainerProperty is generated.
📖 Notable implementations: 'ArrayContainerPropertyGenerator', 'MapContainerPropertyGenerator' Exclude Classes or Packages from Generation # pushExceptGenerateType, addExceptGenerateClass, addExceptGenerateClasses, addExceptGeneratePackage, addExceptGeneratePackages
If you want to exclude the generation of certain types or packages, you can use these options.
Java Kotlin @Test void testExcludeClass() { FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .addExceptGenerateClass(String.class) .build(); String actual = sut.giveMeOne(Product.class) .getProductName(); then(actual).isNull(); } @Test void testExcludePackage() { FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .addExceptGeneratePackage(&#34;java.lang&#34;) .build(); String actual = sut.giveMeOne(String.class); then(actual).isNull(); } @Test fun testExcludeClass() { val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .addExceptGenerateClass(String::class.java) .build() val actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeOne&lt;Product&gt;() .productName then(actual).isNull() } @Test fun testExcludePackage() { val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .addExceptGeneratePackage(&#34;java.lang&#34;) .build() val actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeOne&lt;String&gt;() then(actual).isNull() } Modify Containers # Container Size # defaultArbitraryContainerInfoGenerator, pushArbitraryContainerInfoGenerator
ArbitraryContainerInfo holds information about the minimum and maximum sizes of a Container type. You can change the behavior by modifying the ArbitraryContainerInfoGenerator using related options.
The following example demonstrates how to customize ArbitraryContainerInfo to set the size of all container types to 3.
Java Kotlin @Test void test() { FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .defaultArbitraryContainerInfoGenerator(context -&gt; new ArbitraryContainerInfo(3, 3)) .build(); List&lt;String&gt; actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeOne(); then(actual).hasSize(3); } @Test fun test() { val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .defaultArbitraryContainerInfoGenerator { context -&gt; ArbitraryContainerInfo(3, 3) } .build() val actual: List&lt;String&gt; = fixtureMonkey.giveMeOne() then(actual).hasSize(3) } Adding Container type # addContainerType
You can add a new custom Container type using the addContainerType option.
Let&rsquo;s say you made a new custom Pair class in Java.
You can use this container type by implementing a custom ContainerPropertyGenerator, Introspector and DecomposedContainerValueFactory.
FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey=FixtureMonkey.builder() .addContainerType( Pair.class, new PairContainerPropertyGenerator(), new PairIntrospector(), new PairDecomposedContainerValueFactory() ) .build(); custom Introspector:
public class PairIntrospector implements ArbitraryIntrospector, Matcher { private static final Matcher MATCHER = new AssignableTypeMatcher(Pair.class); @Override public boolean match(Property property) { return MATCHER.match(property); } @Override public ArbitraryIntrospectorResult introspect(ArbitraryGeneratorContext context) { ArbitraryProperty property = context.getArbitraryProperty(); ArbitraryContainerInfo containerInfo = property.getContainerProperty().getContainerInfo(); if (containerInfo == null) { return ArbitraryIntrospectorResult.EMPTY; } List&lt;Arbitrary&lt;?&gt;&gt; childrenArbitraries = context.getChildrenArbitraryContexts().getArbitraries(); BuilderCombinator&lt;List&lt;Object&gt;&gt; builderCombinator = Builders.withBuilder(ArrayList::new); for (Arbitrary&lt;?&gt; childArbitrary : childrenArbitraries) { builderCombinator = builderCombinator.use(childArbitrary).in((list, element) -&gt; { list.add(element); return list; }); } return new ArbitraryIntrospectorResult( builderCombinator.build(it -&gt; new Pair&lt;&gt;(it.get(0), it.get(1))) ); } } custom ContainerPropertyGenerator:
public class PairContainerPropertyGenerator implements ContainerPropertyGenerator { @Override public ContainerProperty generate(ContainerPropertyGeneratorContext context) { com.navercorp.fixturemonkey.api.property.Property property = context.getProperty(); List&lt;AnnotatedType&gt; elementTypes = Types.getGenericsTypes(property.getAnnotatedType()); if (elementTypes.size() != 2) { throw new IllegalArgumentException( &quot;Pair elementsTypes must be have 1 generics type for element. &quot; + &quot;propertyType: &quot; + property.getType() + &quot;, elementTypes: &quot; + elementTypes ); } AnnotatedType firstElementType = elementTypes.get(0); AnnotatedType secondElementType = elementTypes.get(1); List&lt;com.navercorp.fixturemonkey.api.property.Property&gt; elementProperties = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); elementProperties.add( new ElementProperty( property, firstElementType, 0, 0 ) ); elementProperties.add( new ElementProperty( property, secondElementType, 1, 1 ) ); return new ContainerProperty( elementProperties, new ArbitraryContainerInfo(1, 1, false) ); } } custom DecomposedContainerValueFactory:
public class PairDecomposedContainerValueFactory implements DecomposedContainerValueFactory { @Override public DecomposedContainerValue from(Object object) { Pair&lt;?, ?&gt; pair = (Pair&lt;?, ?&gt;)obj; List&lt;Object&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); list.add(pair.getFirst()); list.add(pair.getSecond()); return new DecomposableContainerValue(list, 2); } } Customize Arbitrary Validation # arbitraryValidator
The arbitraryValidator option allows you to replace the default arbitraryValidator with your own custom arbitrary validator.
When an instance is sampled, the arbitraryValidator validates the arbitrary, and if it is invalid, it throws an exception. This process is repeated 1,000 times, and if the instance is still invalid, a TooManyFilterMissesException would be thrown.
📖 Notable implementations: 'JakartaArbitraryValidator', 'JavaxArbitraryValidator' Java Kotlin FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .arbitraryValidator(obj -&gt; { throw new ValidationFailedException(&#34;thrown by custom ArbitraryValidator&#34;, new HashSet&lt;&gt;()); }) .build(); thenThrownBy(() -&gt; fixtureMonkey.giveMeOne(String.class)) .isExactlyInstanceOf(FilterMissException.class); val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .arbitraryValidator { obj -&gt; throw ValidationFailedException(&#34;thrown by custom ArbitraryValidator&#34;, HashSet()) } .build() assertThatThrownBy { fixtureMonkey.giveMeOne&lt;String&gt;() } .isExactlyInstanceOf(FilterMissException::class.java) Modify Arbitrary Generation Retry Limits # generateMaxTries, generateUniqueMaxTries
The generateMaxTries option allows you to control the maximum number of attempts to generate a valid object from an arbitrary. If an object cannot be generated successfully after exceeding this limit (default is 1,000 attempts), a TooManyFilterMissesException will be thrown.
Additionally, Fixture Monkey ensures the generation of unique values for map keys and set elements. The generateUniqueMaxTries option allows you to specify the maximum number of attempts (also defaults to 1,000) that will be made to generate this unique value.

interfaceImplements is an option used to specify the available implementations for an interface.
When you don&rsquo;t specify this option, an ArbitraryBuilder for an interface will always result in a null value when sampled. However, when you do specify this option, Fixture Monkey will randomly generate one of the specified implementations whenever an ArbitraryBuilder for the interface is sampled.
Java Kotlin interface FixedValue { Object get(); } class IntegerFixedValue implements FixedValue { @Override public Object get() { return 1; } } class StringFixedValue implements FixedValue { @Override public Object get() { return &#34;fixed&#34;; } } class GenericFixedValue&lt;T&gt; { T value; } @Test void sampleGenericInterface() { // given List&lt;Class&lt;? extends FixedValue&gt;&gt; implementations = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); implementations.add(IntegerFixedValue.class); implementations.add(StringFixedValue.class); FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .interfaceImplements(FixedValue.class, implementations) .build(); // when Object actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(new TypeReference&lt;GenericGetFixedValue&lt;FixedValue&gt;&gt;() {}) .setNotNull(&#34;value&#34;) .sample() .getValue() .get(); // then then(actual).isIn(1, &#34;fixed&#34;); } interface FixedValue { fun get(): Any } class IntegerFixedValue : FixedValue { override fun get(): Any { return 1 } } class StringFixedValue : FixedValue { override fun get(): Any { return &#34;fixed&#34; } } class GenericFixedValue&lt;T&gt; { val value: T } @Test fun sampleGenericInterface() { // given val implementations: MutableList&lt;Class&lt;out FixedValue&gt;&gt; = List.of(IntegerFixedValue::class.java, StringFixedValue::class.java) val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .interfaceImplements(FixedValue::class.java, implementations) .build() // when val actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;GenericGetFixedValue&lt;FixedValue&gt;&gt;() .sample() .getValue() .get() // then then(actual).isIn(1, &#34;fixed&#34;) } `}),e.add({id:22,href:"/docs/fixture-monkey-options/customization-options/",title:"Customization Options",description:`Fixture Monkey also provides options through the FixtureMonkeyBuilder to customize objects to have the desired values or to use custom property names.

Change how property names are resolved # defaultPropertyNameResolver, pushPropertyNameResolver, pushAssignableTypePropertyNameResolver, pushExactTypePropertyNameResolver
Options related to the PropertyNameResolver allow you to customize how you refer to your properties.
The defaultPropertyNameResolver option is used to change the way property names are figured out for all types. If you want to make specific changes for certain types, you can use pushPropertyNameResolver, pushAssignableTypePropertyNameResolver, or pushExactTypePropertyNameResolver.
By default, a property will be referenced by its original name. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the following example to see how we can customize the property name:
Java Kotlin @Data // getter, setter public class Product { String productName; } @Test void test() { // given FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .pushPropertyNameResolver(MatcherOperator.exactTypeMatchOperator(String.class, (property) -&gt; &#34;string&#34;)) .build(); String expected = &#34;test&#34;; // when String actual = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .set(&#34;string&#34;, expected) .sample() .getProductName(); // then then(actual).isEqualTo(expected); } data class Product ( val productName: String ) @Test fun test() { // given val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .plugin(KotlinPlugin()) .pushPropertyNameResolver( MatcherOperator.exactTypeMatchOperator(String::class.java, PropertyNameResolver { &#34;string&#34; }) ) .build() val expected = &#34;test&#34; // when val actual: String = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .set(&#34;string&#34;, expected) .sample() .productName // then then(actual).isEqualTo(expected) } Normally, the property name will resolve to the original property name &ldquo;productName&rdquo;. However, with pushPropertyNameResolver the String type properties are now referred to by the name &ldquo;string&rdquo;.
Register a default ArbitraryBuilder for a given type # register, registerGroup, registerExactType, registerAssignableType
Sometimes your class may need to consistently match certain constraints. It can be inconvenient and result in lengthy code if you always have to modify the ArbitraryBuilder using customization APIs. In such cases, you can set a default ArbitraryBuilder for a class that will satisfy all the basic constraints.
The register option helps to register an ArbitraryBuilder for a specific type.
For example, the following code demonstrates how to register an ArbitraryBuilder for a Product class. By doing so, all Product instances created by FixtureMonkey will have an id value greater than or equal to &ldquo;0&rdquo;.
Java Kotlin FixtureMonkey.builder() .register( Product.class, fixture -&gt; fixture.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .set(&#34;id&#34;, Arbitraries.longs().greaterOrEqual(0)) ) .build(); FixtureMonkey.builder() .register(Product::class.java) { it.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .set(&#34;id&#34;, Arbitraries.longs().greaterOrEqual(0)) } .build() If you want to register several ArbitraryBuilders at once, you can use the registerGroup option. This can be done using either reflection or the ArbitraryBuilderGroup interface.
Using reflection: Java Kotlin public class GenerateGroup { public ArbitraryBuilder&lt;GenerateString&gt; generateString(FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey) { return fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(GenerateString.class) .set(&#34;value&#34;, Arbitraries.strings().numeric()); } public ArbitraryBuilder&lt;GenerateInt&gt; generateInt(FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey) { return fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(GenerateInt.class) .set(&#34;value&#34;, Arbitraries.integers().between(1, 100)); } } FixtureMonkey.builder() .registerGroup(GenerateGroup.class) .build(); class GenerateGroup { fun generateString(fixtureMonkey: FixtureMonkey): ArbitraryBuilder&lt;GenerateString&gt; { return fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;GenerateString&gt;() .set(&#34;value&#34;, Arbitraries.strings().numeric()) } fun generateInt(fixtureMonkey: FixtureMonkey): ArbitraryBuilder&lt;GenerateInt&gt; { return fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;GenerateInt&gt;() .set(&#34;value&#34;, Arbitraries.integers().between(1, 100)) } } FixtureMonkey.builder() .registerGroup(GenerateGroup::class.java) .build() Using ArbitraryBuilderGroup interface:
Java Kotlin public class GenerateBuilderGroup implements ArbitraryBuilderGroup { @Override public ArbitraryBuilderCandidateList generateCandidateList() { return ArbitraryBuilderCandidateList.create() .add( ArbitraryBuilderCandidateFactory.of(GenerateString.class) .builder( arbitraryBuilder -&gt; arbitraryBuilder .set(&#34;value&#34;, Arbitraries.strings().numeric()) ) ) .add( ArbitraryBuilderCandidateFactory.of(GenerateInt.class) .builder( builder -&gt; builder .set(&#34;value&#34;, Arbitraries.integers().between(1, 100)) ) ); } } FixtureMonkey.builder() .registerGroup(new GenerateBuilderGroup()) .build(); class GenerateBuilderGroup : ArbitraryBuilderGroup { override fun generateCandidateList(): ArbitraryBuilderCandidateList { return ArbitraryBuilderCandidateList.create() .add( ArbitraryBuilderCandidateFactory.of(GenerateString::class.java) .builder { it.set(&#34;value&#34;, Arbitraries.strings().numeric()) } ) .add( ArbitraryBuilderCandidateFactory.of(GenerateInt::class.java) .builder { it.set(&#34;value&#34;, Arbitraries.integers().between(1, 100)) } ) } } FixtureMonkey.builder() .registerGroup(GenerateBuilderGroup()) .build() Use expression strict mode # useExpressionStrictMode
When using expressions (especially String Expressions), it&rsquo;s hard to know if the expression you&rsquo;ve written has a matching property, and the property is correctly adjusted. Using the useExpressionStrictMode option will throw an IllegalArgumentException if the expression you wrote doesn&rsquo;t have a matching property.
Java Kotlin @Test void test() { FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder().useExpressionStrictMode().build(); thenThrownBy( () -&gt; fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder(String.class) .set(&#34;nonExistentField&#34;, 0) .sample() ).isExactlyInstanceOf(IllegalArgumentException.class) .hasMessageContaining(&#34;No matching results for given NodeResolvers.&#34;); } @Test fun test() { val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder().useExpressionStrictMode().build() assertThatThrownBy { fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;String&gt;() .set(&#34;nonExistentField&#34;, 0) .sample() }.isExactlyInstanceOf(IllegalArgumentException::class.java) .hasMessageContaining(&#34;No matching results for given NodeResolvers.&#34;) } Constrain Java types # javaTypeArbitraryGenerator, javaTimeTypeArbitraryGenerator
You can modify the default values for Java primitive types (such as strings, integers, doubles, etc.) by implementing a custom JavaTypeArbitraryGenerator interface. This option can be applied through the JqwikPlugin.
For example, by default, string types generated with Fixture Monkey have unreadable data because it considers edge cases such as when control blocks are contained in strings.
If you prefer to generate strings consisting only of alphabetic characters, you can override the JavaTypeArbitraryGenerator as demonstrated below:
Java Kotlin FixtureMonkey.builder() .plugin( new JqwikPlugin() .javaTypeArbitraryGenerator(new JavaTypeArbitraryGenerator() { @Override public StringArbitrary strings() { return Arbitraries.strings().alpha(); } }) ) .build(); FixtureMonkey.builder() .plugin( JqwikPlugin() .javaTypeArbitraryGenerator(object : JavaTypeArbitraryGenerator { override fun strings(): StringArbitrary = Arbitraries.strings().alpha() }) ) .build() For Java time types, you can use javaTimeTypeArbitraryGenerator.
Constrain Java types with annotations # javaArbitraryResolver, javaTimeArbitraryResolver
Similar to using the javax-validation plugin and adding constraints to your Java typed properties, you can apply constraints to Java types using annotations. To do this, you can implement a JavaArbitraryResolver interface. This option can be applied through the JqwikPlugin.
For example, if you have a custom annotation named MaxLengthOf10, which means that the length of a property should be limited to a maximum of 10 characters, you can create a JavaArbitraryResolver as shown below:
Java Kotlin FixtureMonkey.builder() .plugin( new JqwikPlugin() .javaArbitraryResolver(new JavaArbitraryResolver() { @Override public Arbitrary&lt;String&gt; strings(StringArbitrary stringArbitrary, ArbitraryGeneratorContext context) { if (context.findAnnotation(MaxLengthof10.class).isPresent()) { return stringArbitrary.ofMaxLength(10); } return stringArbitrary; } }) ) .build(); FixtureMonkey.builder() .plugin( JqwikPlugin() .javaArbitraryResolver(object : JavaArbitraryResolver { override fun strings(stringArbitrary: StringArbitrary, context: ArbitraryGeneratorContext): Arbitrary&lt;String&gt; { if (context.findAnnotation(MaxLengthof10::class.java).isPresent) { return stringArbitrary.ofMaxLength(10) } return stringArbitrary } }) ) .build() Change Nullability # defaultNotNull # defaultNotNull, nullableContainer, nullableElement
When you want to ensure that the properties of your instance are not null, you can utilize the options mentioned below.
defaultNotNull determines whether a null property is generated. If true, property cannot be null nullableContainer determines whether a container property can be null. If true, container can be null nullableElement determines whether an element within a container property can be null. If true, element can be null. By default, these three options are set to false. You can modify them to true as needed.
🚨 These options only apply to properties that do not have a nullable marker, such as @Nullable in Java or ? in Kotlin. Java Kotlin FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder().defaultNotNull(true).build(); FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder().nullableContainer(true).build(); FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder().nullableElement(true).build(); val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder().defaultNotNull(true).build() val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder().nullableContainer(true).build() val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder().nullableElement(true).build() NullInjectGenerator # defaultNullInjectGenerator, pushNullInjectGenerator, pushExactTypeNullInjectGenerator, pushAssignableTypeNullInjectGenerator
In cases where a property should be null regardless of any nullable markers, you can make use of the options associated with the NullInjectGenerator.
The defaultnullInjectGenerator option allows you to set the probability of properties being null.
By default, the probability of a property being null is set to 20%.
If you want it to always be null, you can set it to 1.0d. There are predefined values available in the DefaultNullInjectGenerator—NOT_NULL_INJECT(0.0d) and ALWAYS_NULL_INJECT(1.0d)—which you can import and use.
Alternatively, for more customized behavior, you can implement your own NullInjectGenerator.
Java Kotlin FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .defaultNullInjectGenerator((context) -&gt; NOT_NULL_INJECT) // you can use NOT_NULL_INJECT or write your probability as 0.4 .build() val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .plugin(KotlinPlugin()) .defaultNullInjectGenerator { NOT_NULL_INJECT } // you can use NOT_NULL_INJECT or write your probability as 0.4 .build() If you want to specifically change the probability of a certain type being null, you can use pushNullInjectGenerator.
Java Kotlin FixtureMonkey fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .pushNullInjectGenerator(MatcherOperator.exactTypeMatchOperator(SimpleObject.class, (context) -&gt; NOT_NULL_INJECT)) .build(); val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .pushNullInjectGenerator( exactTypeMatchOperator( Product::class.java, NullInjectGenerator { context -&gt; NOT_NULL_INJECT } ) ) .build() Registering an ArbitraryBuilder of a specific class with register that has the .setNotNull(&quot;*&quot;) setting will have the same effect.

Let&rsquo;s look at the example of customizing properties with Kotlin Exp using setExp() and setExpGetter().
@Test fun test() { // given val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .plugin(KotlinPlugin()) .plugin(JacksonPlugin()) .build() // when val javaClass = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;JavaClass&gt;() .setExpGetter(JavaClass::getField, &quot;field&quot;) .sample() val kotlinClass = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;KotlinClass&gt;() .setExp(KotlinClass::field, &quot;field&quot;) .sample() // then then(javaClass.field).isEqualTo(&quot;field&quot;) then(kotlinClass.field).isEqualTo(&quot;field&quot;) } In the code above, we can see that we are using Kotlin&rsquo;s method reference to select a property.
setExp() takes an argument of type KProperty, while setExpGetter() takes an argument of type KFunction.
If the class is defined in Java, the expression (e.g. JavaClass::getField) is of type KFunction because it is a reference to a Java getter. Therefore you can only use the setExpGetter() method.
If it is a Kotlin class, the expression (e.g. KotlinClass::field) is KProperty, so you should use setExp().
Referencing a nested property # To access a nested field, the infix functions into and intoGetter are used. into takes a parameter of type KProperty, while intoGetter takes a parameter of type KFunction.
@Test fun test() { // given val fixtureMonkey = FixtureMonkey.builder() .plugin(KotlinPlugin()) .plugin(JacksonPlugin()) .build() // when val javaClass = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;JavaClass&gt;() .setExp(JavaClass::getNestedObject intoGetter JavaClass.Nested::getNestedField, &quot;nestedField&quot;) .sample() val kotlinClass = fixtureMonkey.giveMeBuilder&lt;KotlinClass&gt;() .setExp(KotlinClass::nestedObject into KotlinClass.Nested::nestedField, &quot;nestedField&quot;) .sample() then(javaClass.nestedObject.nestedField).isEqualTo(&quot;nestedField&quot;) then(kotlinClass.nestedObject.nestedField).isEqualTo(&quot;nestedField&quot;) } An expression that contains an into or intoGetter operator becomes an ExpressionGenerator type in fixture monkey. Both setExp() and setExpGetter()) are defined to take ExpressionGenerator types as arguments, so you can use both.

The test passes if, for all input values, the function returns true.
This function accepts type parameters for the argument types, which Kotest uses to locate a generator that provides random values of a suitable type.
class PropertyExample: StringSpec({ &quot;String size&quot; { forAll&lt;String, String&gt; { a, b -&gt; (a + b).length == a.length + b.length } } }) For cases when a custom generator is needed, it&rsquo;s possible to specify generators (called Arb in Kotest). However, only generators of limited types are provided with kotest, and it is hard to customize.
Fixture Monkey offers a way to generate Arb for custom types using the giveMeArb() function. You can further customize the generator using Fixture Monkey&rsquo;s customization APIs.
Here&rsquo;s an example of performing property-based testing with forAll using Fixture Monkey:
class KotestInKotestTest : StringSpec({ &quot;forAll&quot; { forAll(fixtureMonkey.giveMeArb&lt;StringObject&gt; { it.set(&quot;value&quot;, &quot;test&quot;) }) { a -&gt; a.value == &quot;test&quot; } } }) { data class StringObject(val value: String) } CheckAll # Fixture Monkey also provides the extension function checkAll similar to Kotest&rsquo;s checkAll.
Primitive Type Input # With checkAll, you can test assertions against primitive data types, as shown in the example below:
class Test : StringSpec({ &quot;checkAll&quot; { SUT.checkAll { string: String, int: Int -&gt; string shouldNotBeSameInstanceAs int string shouldBe string } } }) Custom Type Input # Fixture Monkey&rsquo;s checkAll extension function goes beyond primitive types. You can also use custom types as input data, generated with Fixture Monkey.
class Test : StringSpec({ &quot;checkAllObject&quot; { SUT.checkAll { stringObject: StringObject -&gt; stringObject.value shouldNotBe null } } }) { data class StringObject(val value: String) } ArbitraryBuilder Input # Additionally, you can work with ArbitraryBuilder instances and further customize them to execute assertions.
class Test : StringSpec({ &quot;checkAllArbitraryBuilder&quot; { SUT.checkAll { string: ArbitraryBuilder&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; -&gt; string .size(&quot;$&quot;, 3) .sample() shouldHaveSize 3 } } }) { data class StringObject(val value: String) } `}),e.add({id:41,href:"/docs/cheat-sheet/",title:"Cheat sheet",description:"",content:""}),e.add({id:42,href:"/docs/cheat-sheet/faq/",title:"FAQ",description:`How can I limit the range of characters for my generated Strings? # Related - How can I constrain the range of my generated Instant values?

Normally, if you want to add constraints to your fixture, you can do so using the Fixture Customization APIs provided with the ArbitraryBuilder. However, in cases where you want each generated primitive type to adhere to specific constraints, you can use the javaTypeArbitaryGenerator and javaTimeTypeArbitraryGenerator options.
The javaTypeArbitaryGenerator option allows you to customize the default values for primitive types such as Strings or Integers. For time types, such as Instant, you can use the javaTimeTypeArbitraryGenerator option.
This option is particularly useful if you want the generated strings to fall within a certain range of characters, or if you want your time types to be generated at predefined intervals.
How can I exclude certain values from being generated? # You can easily specify a value using set(), but there may be cases where you want to EXCLUDE certain values.
For instance, you might have an Enum-typed field in your class, and you don&rsquo;t want it to have certain values. In these situations, you can use set() as shown below.
Java Kotlin Product product = sut.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .set(&#34;productType&#34;, ArbitraryUtils.toCombinableArbitrary(Arbitraries.of(ProductType)).filter(it -&gt; it != CLOTHING &amp;&amp; it != ELECTRONICS))) .sample(); val product = sut.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .setExpGetter(Product::getProductType, ArbitraryUtils.toCombinableArbitrary(Arbitraries.of(ProductType::class.java)).filter { it != ProductType.CLOTHING &amp;&amp; it != ProductType.ELECTRONICS }) .sample() Or you can use setPostCondition() which works like a filter.
Java Kotlin Product product = sut.giveMeBuilder(Product.class) .setPostCondition(&#34;productType&#34;, ProductType.class, it -&gt; it != CLOTHING || it != ELECTRONICS) .sample(); val product = sut.giveMeBuilder&lt;Product&gt;() .setPostConditionExpGetter(Product::getProductType, ProductType::class.java) { it != ProductType.CLOTHING || it != ProductType.ELECTRONICS } .sample() Please note that using setPostCondition() can incur higher costs for narrow conditions because it filters after the Product instance has been created. In such cases, it&rsquo;s recommended to use set() instead.
